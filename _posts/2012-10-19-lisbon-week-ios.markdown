From the 22nd to the 28th of October the city of Lisbon will be the stage of the first edition of Lisbon Week, a cultural and touristic project created by XN Brand Dynamics and co-produced with the City Hall.

Having the 7 hills of Lisbon as a starting point, during 7 days it will be possible to discover 7 routes, each dedicated to a theme: Art, History, Panoramic, Gastronomy, Music, Fashion and Tradition, each route designed by an ambassador. Names like José Avillez, José Cabral, José Pedro from the renowned Portuguese rock band “Xutos e Pontapés”, Isabel Sarmento, João Botelho, Carlos Coelho and José Sarmento de Matos will share their interpretations of Lisbon.

Each one of the routes can start to be explored from places like: Miradouro São Pedro de Alcântara, Praça Camões, Largo de São Paulo or Martim Moniz. All of them will present a special and contemporary view of the city where galleries, shops, museums, bars, churches, theaters, streets and palaces can be visited.
